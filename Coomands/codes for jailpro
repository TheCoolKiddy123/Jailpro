/jailversion

Shows which version of Jail you are using.


/jailcheck (player name)

Check the status of the specified prisoner. If you type it without argument, it will display all jailed prisoners.


/jailclear

Release all prisoners from every jail on the server. Use with caution.


/jailclearforce

Delete all prisoners from database, which means that they will not be jailed anymore, but they will also not be teleported out. Use with caution.


/jail [player name] (time) m j:(Jail name) c:(Cell name) r:"(Reason)"

You can left out any parameters except name you want and you can put them in any order you want (so /jail matejdro r:"just for fun" j:eviljail is still valid).

Time means for how long will prisoner be jailed. Enter it in minutes, leave it out or enter -1 to jail him forever (or until you manually release him).

Jail name and cell name are names of the jail and cell prisoner will be jailed in. If you left it out, nearest jail and random cell will be used automatically.

Reason is reason for jailing. It will say it in /jailstatus and on cell sign. If your reason is more than one word, you must use brackets (for example r:"some very long reason"), otherwise you don't have to (for example r:griefer).

If you add m parameter, prisoner will be muted instantly after being jailed.

/jailrecord [player name] (list)

This command will allow you to see if the player specified has ever been jailed before. Just "/jailrecord [player name]" will show you the number of times the specific player has been jailed.

/handcuff [player name]

This command allows you to handcuff a player, meaning they are unable to move, chat (except /reply), place, or destroy blocks, until you un-handcuff them. Use this as the police do, to allow you to freeze a player until you can assess the situation. Get everything straight and know what rules they have broken and how badly, then Jail them.


/unhandcuff [player name]
